Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my journey with you.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've been working with static site generators for a while, and I fell in love with the simplicity and speed of **11ty**. Combined with **Decap CMS**, it creates the perfect headless CMS solution for a blog.

### Features of This Setup

1. **Blazing Fast Performance** - Static sites load instantly
2. **Easy Content Management** - Decap CMS provides a beautiful editor
3. **Git-Based Workflow** - All content is version controlled
4. **Customizable** - Complete control over design and functionality

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- Web development tutorials
- Design tips and tricks
- Productivity workflows
- Case studies from my projects
- Thoughts on technology trends
